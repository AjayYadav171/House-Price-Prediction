The Blood Donation Project aims to create a system that facilitates and encourages blood donation by connecting donors with blood banks and hospitals in need. The project involves developing a platform that helps donors track donation schedules, receive reminders, and provide information on eligibility criteria, donation locations, and blood types in demand. Additionally, the system may incorporate data analytics to predict and manage blood supply based on regional needs. By improving communication and awareness, the project seeks to streamline the donation process, ensure adequate blood supplies, and promote the importance of regular blood donation to save lives.
